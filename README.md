# HaxeDesignPatternPractice
A collection of examples for common design patterns that I implemented in order to gain more practice using them.
This is a very basic OpenFL project using Haxe and mostly some basic shapes for the pattern examples.

You can try it out here:

However you will probably need to look at the examples to make sense of it. The UI is basic/stupid, just click the button in the top center to go to the next example.
