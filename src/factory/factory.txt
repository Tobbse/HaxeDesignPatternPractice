The Factory pattern should be very clear, I use it at work every day.

It is a creational design pattern that provides a central place to create objects of certain types.

Within Forge, we actually use factory methods only, we don't exactly follow the factory pattern.
It basically just iterates over some enum or string, in order to call the correct fuction or return the correct type. 

It can actually be much more complicated than that. Check this link, also for abstract factories:
