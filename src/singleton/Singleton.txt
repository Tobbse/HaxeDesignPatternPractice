Look at Main or EventManger to see a singleton example.

The singleton pattern is a creational pattern.
It makes sure that there is only one specific object of
a given class. It does so by making the constructor of this
object private. The instance can only be accessed by calling
a function like `getInstance`. Usually, if this instance was
not yet created and `null`, it is then created.
Therefore, no matter when you access the object, you will always
get an instance of the class and it will always be the same one.
