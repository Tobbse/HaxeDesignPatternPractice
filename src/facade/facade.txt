A facade is a design pattern that hides the complexity of some underlying code (maybe a framework or library).
It acts as an interface providing a useable API for the internal structure.

An example for this is the CollectingMinigameController or PVPArenaController that I've implemented in FOE.

Another example for this is the CityEntityProxy that we are using in Forge, which is actually not a proxy for
some kind of building, but rather a facade providing an API to working with the building.
