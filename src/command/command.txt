The Command pattern should be very clear, I use it at work every day.

Command is a behavioral pattern, which takes care of one specific common task or request.
It contains all information about this task and takes care about reducing the amount of
duplicated code throughout the code base, by having it in the command as a central place.

It does so by converting an operation into an object.

The common definition of commands allows us to pass them around as parameters, for example
in order to combine them with the strategy pattern. At Forge, we instead use the Robotlegs-version
of commands, which work a bit differently. They simply just centralize a certain task while
listening for a trigger. 
They do however have the same purpose of heavily enforcing the single responsibility principle.
