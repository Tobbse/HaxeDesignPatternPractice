The Mediator pattern should be very clear, I use it at work every day.

A mediator is a behavioral pattern that is used as a communication layer
between other objects. In many cases it servers as a layer between actors,
controllers and models on one side and the view on the other side. Other
objects would only communicate with this view via the mediator.

It helps reducing dependencies and organize the collaboration between classes
acording to the Single Responsibility, that would otherwise be chaotic.
You can also create new mediators without changing the (view) components,
achieving a higher degree of the Open/Closed principle.
